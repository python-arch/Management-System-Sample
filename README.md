# School Management System

This Java project implements a simple school management system with a menu-driven interface using Swing components. The system allows users to manage a list of students, including adding, updating, and deleting student records. The application connects to a MySQL database to store and retrieve student information.

## Features

- Add new students to the system with their names and grades.
- Update existing student records with new information.
- Delete students from the system.
- Display a list of all students in the system.

## Technologies Used

- Java Swing for the graphical user interface.
- MySQL for the database management.
- JDBC for connecting Java applications to the database.

## Usage

To run the application:

1. Make sure you have Java and MySQL installed on your system.
2. Set up a MySQL database with the following credentials:
   - URL: `jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/school`
   - Username: `your_user_name`
   - Password: `your_password`
3. Compile and run the `MenuDrivenSystem` class.
